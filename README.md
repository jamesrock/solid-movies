This repo forms part of a project where I built the same app using Svelte, Nuxt, Next, Solid and Angular — all but one of which I'd never use before — in an effort to show that picking-up frameworks isn't quite the huge deal hiring managers seem to think it is...

The app itself is nothing overly fancy — just a basic film discovery site covering all the essentials one would expect such as search (actor/director/title), categories, filmographies, cast & crew. I took a classic ‘less is more’ approach with regards to the UI. It’s certainly not the most impressive thing you’ll ever see — but it is a perfectly functional single-page app fetching data from a live API, which is very much the bread and butter of modern front-end development.

### Project Summary

Solid is similar in many ways to Next/React, both use JSX — although, interestingly, Solid doesn’t stipulate using ‘className’ in place of ‘class’ attributes. Their ‘signals’ work in the exact same way as React’s useState mechanism, which is okay, though I certainly prefer Svelte’s approach. It took just half a day to get this version of the app up and running. I found it very easy to grasp. Their docs are decent enough, although I initially had some trouble running the setup script, until I realised I was using an old version — the up-to-date one was very nicely done, on par with Svelte’s, and worked a treat. Overall, although it does have all the features you’d expect from a modern framework, there’s nothing to positively differentiate it from Next.
