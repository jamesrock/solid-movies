## Developing

Install dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), then start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

Solid apps are built with _presets_, which optimise your project for deployment to different environments.

By default, `npm run build` will generate a Node app that you can run with `npm start`. To use a different preset, add it to the `devDependencies` in `package.json` and specify in your `app.config.js`.

## This project was created with the [Solid CLI](https://github.com/solidjs-community/solid-cli)
